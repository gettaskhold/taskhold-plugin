name: taskhold
description: Work from the task list the user shares with their coding agents through the Taskhold MCP server (https://taskhold.com/api/mcp, Bearer key from a Taskhold setup URL). Use at the start of a coding session and when the user says "work on the next task", "what's next", "what's on my list", "pick up my next todo", "check my task list", "file this as a task", "add a TODO for later", "put this on the backlog", "remind me to fix this later", "mark that done", "leave a note on the task", "what did the agent do", "turn these TODO comments into tasks", "what's in progress", "show progress", "how far along is it", "report progress as you go", "break this into steps", or "I'm blocked on this". Also use when you need the human to decide something (block the task with a question). For the session's built-in todo checklist or a repo TODO.md the user points at, use those directly. For production errors and crash reports, use the user's error tracker.

# Taskhold

Taskhold is a hosted task list shared by a person and their coding agents. The person adds and orders tasks in a web app (https://taskhold.com/dashboard) and can watch a live board (https://taskhold.com/dashboard/live) while you work: your steps, a progress bar and what you're doing right now. You read and update the same list through the `taskhold_*` MCP tools. Every change you make is recorded as an agent change, so the person can see what you did.

## Not connected yet?

If no `taskhold_*` tools are available, tell the user to open Taskhold > Settings, make a setup URL, and paste it to you with "set this up". Fetch that URL: it is markdown with an API key and the exact config for your client. Do not invent a key.

## Projects

Pass `project: "<repo folder name>"` on every call (the folder you're working in, e.g. `"api-server"`). Projects are matched by name, case-insensitively, and created the first time you use one, so you never look up an id. Outside a repo, leave project out.

## Session start

1. `taskhold_get_current` with `project`. If a task is in progress, it was probably left by an earlier session: read it with `taskhold_get` (steps and notes included) and continue from the next open step.
2. `taskhold_updates` with `project` to see what the person changed while you were away (replies on blocked tasks, new tasks, priority changes). Keep the cursor it returns.
3. The person asked for something: `taskhold_begin` with `title`, `project`, `steps` and `agent`. One call files the task, plans the steps, starts it and its first step.
4. Picking up queued work instead: `taskhold_list` with `project` and `status: "todo"`, take the highest priority (urgent, high, medium, low), then `taskhold_begin` with its `task_id` (and `steps`).
5. `agent` is your client and repo, e.g. `"Claude Code in api-server"` (just `"Claude Code"` outside a repo): the person sees it on the board.

## While working

- Steps are subtasks. Finish each with `taskhold_complete` and `start_next: true`: it starts the next step and tells you which. The bar fills as steps finish (steps drive it). Re-plan with `taskhold_plan` and `replace: true` if the approach changes (finished steps stay). For an existing task without a plan: `taskhold_start`, then `taskhold_plan`.
- Order steps so each one depends only on earlier ones, and make the first step the smallest change that proves the approach works.
- When a step finishes, its summary says what you observed (tests passed, the migration ran on N rows), not only what you did.
- If two approaches both look right and the choice is hard to undo, block with both, one line each, and your pick.
- `taskhold_progress` on the running step at milestones: `current`/`total` when you're counting (files migrated, tests passing), `percent` otherwise, and a short `message` about what's happening now. Every few minutes is plenty; never on every tool call.
- `taskhold_add_note` for findings and decisions: what you found, what you changed, what's next. A future session reads these if this one ends.
- Need a decision, credentials, or a review? `taskhold_block` with a specific question as the reason (on the step if only that step is stuck). The person gets it at once and can reply from the board. Wait for the answer with `taskhold_updates` and `task_id`, `since` (your cursor) and `wait: 50`, repeated, or move to other work meanwhile. Don't guess on anything destructive.
- If the reply is unclear, ask one follow-up; after two unclear rounds leave it blocked and work on something else.
- Always block for approval before deleting data, spending money, touching secrets or deploying to production.

## Writing for the person

They read your messages on a phone or a corner of the screen. Point first.
- Progress message: what's happening now, under 80 characters, naming the thing ("Migrating the invoices table"). Counts go in current/total, not the text.
- Blocking question: start with the request type, then what they need to answer without opening the code. "Decide: keep /v1 for 30 days (safer) or remove it now? I recommend 30 days." Other types: "Answer:", "Approve:" (say how to undo it), "Access:" (exactly what's missing).
- Summary: the outcome in the first line, then what changed and how you checked it.

## Finishing

- `taskhold_complete` with a summary: what changed, which files, how you checked it.
- Bugs or TODOs you noticed but shouldn't fix now: `taskhold_create`, or `taskhold_create_from_todo` with `file_path` and `line_number`. Use priority low unless it's a real bug.

## Tools

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| taskhold_begin | Start work in one call: file (or take) a task, plan steps, start it and the first step |
| taskhold_get_current | Task in progress (in a project), its steps and the next one |
| taskhold_list | Tasks by status/priority/project, one line each |
| taskhold_get | One task with steps and notes |
| taskhold_search | Text search |
| taskhold_create / taskhold_create_from_todo | New task (or one step, with parent_task_id) / from a code TODO |
| taskhold_plan | Break a task into ordered steps |
| taskhold_start / taskhold_complete | Claim / finish a task or step, with summary |
| taskhold_progress | Percent or current/total + what's happening now |
| taskhold_block / taskhold_unblock | Block with a question / unblock |
| taskhold_add_note | Progress note |
| taskhold_updates | What the person changed since your cursor (project, task_id, wait) |
| taskhold_update / taskhold_set_priority | Edit |
| taskhold_list_projects / taskhold_create_project | Projects with open work / find-or-create by name |
| taskhold_list_labels / taskhold_get_summary | Context |

## Don't

- Don't paste the API key into chat, commits or task text.
- Don't mark a task complete if you only partly did it; add a note and block or leave it in progress.
- Don't report made-up progress. If you can't count, give a message without a percent.
- Don't put secrets or large code blocks in tasks; file path and line number are enough.
